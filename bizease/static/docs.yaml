    bearer authentication. To create/get an API token, the user must login or signup using the 
    appropriate endpoints, An 'access' and a 'refresh' token will be returned in the response body.
    When an authenticated request is to be made, The API token is then included in the Authorization 
    header of the HTTP request, formatted as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
